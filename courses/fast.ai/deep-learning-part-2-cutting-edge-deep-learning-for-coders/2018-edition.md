  You'll learn the latest developments in deep learning, how to read and implement new academic papers, and how to solve challenging end-to-end problems such as natural language translation. You'll develop a deep understanding of neural network foundations, the most important recent advances in the fields, and how to implement them in the [world's fastest deep learning libraries](http://www.fast.ai/2018/04/30/dawnbench-fastai/), fastai and PyTorch.
