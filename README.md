# My Knowledge Wiki

Hey, this is a place where I **document everything I know** and **learn** so far about the world in the form of an **online book**. I am sharing them in the hope that they would be useful to you as well.

## What kinds of contents

I want to remember more [of what I read](http://austinkleon.com/2016/03/03/how-to-read-more-2/), so I take notes to share [compressed wisdom](https://sivers.org/2do).

## What kinds of notes

* Notes on various computer science \(technical\) topics.
* General notes.
* Notes from projects that I've work on.

* Notes from books and other interesting things that I've read.

I share my knowledge in a longer form by writing [articles](https://medium.com/@cedric_chee). I also love writing code and share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/cedrickchee). You can find all the things I have made and shared thus far [here](https://cedricchee/projects).
